= Spheres: Data

This is the canonical database of content for the "Spheres" character generator. Each item is stored in a yaml document, with the directory structure acting as a sort of api resource path for categorisation. Orphan Branches are where popular "homebrew" content can be stored, though this can also be done via other repositories.

== Format

Best guess at the moment. Totally open to suggestions as to how to best structure the data.

== Contributing

Merge requests are more than welcome.
